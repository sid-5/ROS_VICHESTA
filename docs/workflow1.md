### **Explanation**

> - The bot starts at the start position assigned to it. It checks the obstruction and moves to next room.

> - As the bot enters the new room, it counts the number of balls kept directly infront of it and stores the number. The bot then starts travelling forward avoiding the obstacle to the the 2nd room.

> - The bot again detects and counts the number of balls and adds the number to the previously stored count. It then proceeds to the room with the Aruco markers.

> - The next task for the bot is to read the Aruco markers and colour detection. This will be explained in the next page.
