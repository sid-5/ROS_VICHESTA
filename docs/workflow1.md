### **Explanation**

> - The bot starts at the start position assigned to it.

> - It begins by counting the number of balls kept directly infront of it. The bot then starts travelling forward avoiding the obstacle to the the 2nd room.

> - The bot again detects and counts the number of balls and stores the number. It then proceeds to the room with the Aruco markers.

> - The next task for the bot is to read the Aruco markers and colour detection. This will be explained in the next page.

#### Navigation

> We have used A-star algorithm for path planning of the bot.
